# wasserstein-spn-weight-estimation
A method that uses a Wasserstein loss to optimize the weights of a stochastic Petri net. This method almost directly optimizes the nets Earth Mover's Stochastic Conformance score.

To run the evaluation (evaluation.evaluation_two_phase), you need:
- Python
- Numpy
- Tensorflow
- PM4Py
(a better entry point and Dockerfile is under construction).
